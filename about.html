						<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m a graphic designer &amp; photographer currently working in the field of blindness and disabilities.</p>
						<p>I made my first website in 1999 when I was a teenager. In 2004 I finished a degree in Graphic Design. This eventually led me to the American Printing House for the Blind where I&rsquo;ve worked since 2010, first as a web developer and now as a photographer.</p>
						<p>Here are some unsolicited things other people have said about me:</p>
						
						<blockquote class="is-size-6">
							<p>&ldquo;I wanted to personally thank you for your help with getting the videos produced .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I know your schedule is jam packed, but <span>these videos are going to be a wonderful addition</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I really appreciate your help and time spent.&rdquo; &mdash;M.&nbsp;W.</p>
							<p>&ldquo;Kudos from customer service, they feel those videos will help prevent a ton of service calls.&rdquo; &mdash;A.&nbsp;D.</p>
						</blockquote>
						
						<p>Early in my experience looking through cameras I was deeply influenced by photographer Sam Abell. He teaches what his father taught him, &ldquo;compose and wait.&rdquo; That is, frame your shot but wait to release the shutter until just the right moment, gesture, expression, action, or light.</p>
						<p>Here&rsquo;s some more things other people said about me:</p>
						
						<blockquote class="is-size-6">
							<p>&ldquo;I wanted to thank you for all your fantastic work .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The time you spent prepping for the more difficult video capture .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. was hugely successful and made the work so much easier for the team. We are also very grateful for your patience and willingness to work extra .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Your work puts us comfortably in position for getting this content published. <span>You are a true professional.</span>&rdquo; &mdash;J.&nbsp;S.</p>
							<p>&ldquo;On behalf of our team we want to thank your team for the incredible work you did to produce such meaningful and beautiful videos. Thank you for taking the time to plan and learn about [our organization] in great detail, the resulting videos clearly show <span>you understood our mission, passion and enthusiasm</span>. The children and families are always our first priority and your presentation reflected the same. In short, we loved them.&rdquo; &mdash;J&nbsp; A. </p>
							<p>&ldquo;I want to <span>thank you for your patience, expertise, and diligence</span> with the photos. I am especially appreciative of your chill-ness&mdash; or, for the wordsmith in you, your imperturbability! It helped me change my attitude, which made this week a lot calmer for me.&rdquo; &mdash;L.&nbsp;K.</p>
						</blockquote>
						
						<p>My foray into this discipline of attention has been sustained by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heyirvine/">a career in commercial art</a>, wherein one is inevitably confronted by graphic designer Milton Glaser.</p>
						<p>In a Steven Heller short film called <i>Just Enough Is More</i>, Glaser said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m convinced that it is only through drawing that I actually look at things carefully. The act of drawing makes me conscious of what I&rsquo;m looking at. If I wasn&rsquo;t drawing, I sense that I would not be seeing.&rdquo;</p>
						<p>Here, I see in Glaser&rsquo;s observation the patience of Abell, and I apply it hopefully to the work of making pictures.</p>
