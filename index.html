			<p>Hello, I&rsquo;m a graphic designer and photographer currently working in the field of blindness and disabilities.</p>
			<p>I made my first website in 1999 when I was a teenager. In 2004 I finished a degree in <a href="https://glass.photo/irvine/series/2QwVMQNivsndO0M2yOiyBv-graphic-design">graphic design</a>. Eventually this led me to the American Printing House for the Blind where I&rsquo;ve worked since 2010. Currently I am principally responsible for <a href="https://glass.photo/irvine/series/43U1Ds41n6n9FxF69hKQgW-products">photography</a> and <a href="video.html">videography</a>.</p>
			<p>Early in my experience looking through cameras I was deeply affected by photographer Sam Abell. He teaches what his father taught him, &ldquo;compose and wait.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>That is, frame your shot but wait to release the shutter until just the right moment, gesture, expression, action, or light. This proved an invaluable guiding principle when I began photographing <a href="https://glass.photo/irvine/series/2OpSeU2NNKuClHfIE5Ow8v-schools-for-the-deaf-and-blind">people with disabilities</a>.</p>
			<p>I saw him again recently. He said it had become his goal to make a picture worthy of his hero, Henri Cartier-Bresson. I knew then that my own goal would be to make a picture worthy of Sam Abell.</p>
			<p><a href="https://glass.photo/irvine/">I&rsquo;m working on it.</a></p>
