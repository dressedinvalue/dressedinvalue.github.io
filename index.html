			<p>Early in my experience looking through cameras I was deeply influenced by photographer Sam Abell. He teaches what his father taught him, &rdquo;compose and wait.&ldquo;</p>
			<p>That is, frame your shot but wait to release the shutter until just the right moment, gesture, expression, action, or light. This proved an invaluable guiding principle when I began working as a photographer in the field of blindness and disabilities.</p>
			<p>I saw him again recently. He said it had become his goal to make a picture worthy of his hero, Henri Cartier-Bresson. I knew then that my own goal would be to make a picture worthy of Sam Abell.</p>
